# Trying MongoDB for the First Time

When first trying MongoDB, a user may encounter a document-oriented, NoSQL database. This means that it stores data in semi-structured format, as opposed to traditional relational databases like MySQL, which stores data in tables with rows and columns. MongoDB can be used for a wide range of applications, from small projects to large-scale, high-performance systems.

To start using MongoDB, you will need to install the MongoDB server and the MongoDB client on your computer. You will also need to create a database and a collection to store your data. You can interact with MongoDB using its command-line interface or through a variety of programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Java. This can be done via a driver or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library.

Additionally, MongoDB features features like high scalability, performance, and automatic sharding to handle large amounts of data and traffic. MongoDB also has a rich query language, support for secondary indexes, and various aggregation operations.
